# py-web-hw14

  In this homework assignment, I continued to refine the REST API application from homework 13.
  Using Sphinx, I created the documentation for the homework assignment. To do this, I added basic modularizations to the required functions and methods of the docstrings classes.
  Covered the homework repository modules with unit tests using the Unittest framework. I used the example from the outline for the tests/test_unit_repository_notes.py module as a   basis
  Covered any routes/auth route with functional tests using the pytest framework.
